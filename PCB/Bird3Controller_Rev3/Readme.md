## Development ##
This was developed in [KiCad 8](https://www.kicad.org/), a FOSS EDA suite. Most or all of the symbols, footprints, and 3D models have been included in the repo to reduce the chance of broken references.

## Ordering Information ##
[JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/) is a good place from which to order a PCB.
- The gerber files are in the [./plots](plots) folder.
- The Bill of Materials is at [./BOM.csv](BOM.csv).

These JLCPCB settings were used for the order:
| Setting                 | Value                   |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Layers                  | 2                       |
| Dimension               | 43 mm * 108 mm          |
| PCB Thickness           | 1.6                     |
| Impedance Control       | no                      |
| Material Type           | FR4-Standard TG 135-140 |
| Via Covering            | Tented                  |
| Outer Copper Weight     | 1 oz                    |
| Castellated Holes       | no                      |
| Edge Plating            | no                      |
| Remove Order Number     | Specify a location      |
| Board Outline Tolerance | Â±0.2mm(Regular)         |
