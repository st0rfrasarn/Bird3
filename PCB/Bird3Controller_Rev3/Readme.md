## Development ##
This was developed in [KiCad 8](https://www.kicad.org/), a FOSS EDA suite. Most or all of the symbols, footprints, and 3D models have been included in the repo to reduce the chance of broken references.

## Ordering Information ##
[JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/) is a good place from which to order a PCB.
- The gerber files are in the [./plots](plots) folder.
- The Bill of Materials is at [./BOM.csv](BOM.csv).

These JLCPCB settings were used for the order:
| Setting                 | Value                   |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Layers                  | 2                       |
| Dimension               | 43 mm * 108 mm          |
| PCB Thickness           | 1.6                     |
| Impedance Control       | no                      |
| Material Type           | FR4-Standard TG 135-140 |
| Via Covering            | Tented                  |
| Outer Copper Weight     | 1 oz                    |
| Castellated Holes       | no                      |
| Edge Plating            | no                      |
| Remove Order Number     | Specify a location      |
| Board Outline Tolerance | Â±0.2mm(Regular)         |

## Bill of Materials ##
An interactive BOM generated by [InteractiveHtmlBOM](https://github.com/openscopeproject/InteractiveHtmlBom) is available at [https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://github.com/ysoyjcgoxohxoh/Bird3/blob/master/PCB/Bird3Controller_Rev3/bom/ibom.html](https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://github.com/ysoyjcgoxohxoh/Bird3/blob/master/PCB/Bird3Controller_Rev3/bom/ibom.html)

## PDF Schematic ##
A PDF schematic is available at [Bird3Controller.pdf](Bird3Controller.pdf). When opened in a more advanced viewer such as Acrobat Reader, the components are bookmarked, and both components and nets are clickable as shown in this screenshot, making it easy to open the part's datasheet or Mouser.com listing.
