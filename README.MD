# Bird 3 #

This repository attempts to document the specs and operation of the Bird 3 scooter. It provides a PCB design and associated software for a drop-in replacement Bird Brain compatible with the EA00004 and EA00022 brains.

The PCB is designed in KiCad around an ESP32-S3. It is designed to fit into the original enclosure and use the existing LCD, the [TXW154028S0](./Datasheets/TXW154028S0_SPEC.pdf).

More documentation for the scooter is available in the [Wiki](../../wiki).
